#           Welcome to Verse!
#
#
# This is your site.yml file.
# All of your metadata and content is kept alongside this file, and
# verse parses, assembles and formats the final site in htdocs/.
#
# To get started, you will probably want to change the title of
# your site, and maybe select a different style.
#

site:
  title:    My New Verse Site
  subtitle: some thoughts, some musings...
  author:   Your Name

  # Canonical URL of your site (used for metadata, not linking)
  canon:    http://example.com

  theme: default
  style: city
  #
  # 'styles' let you change the header image,
  # and general color scheme, without having
  # to write your own theme from scratch.
  #
  # try: beach, city, forest, mountain, snow
  #


  # Here you can tell Verse about your Social Media identities;
  # Verse will use this information when generating page metadata
  #id:
  #  facebook: https://www.facebook.com/YOURID
  #  twitter:  YOURID # minus the '@'


# P.S. If you want to get started adding content to your site,
# you'll be interested in the files under data/:
#
#  - data/pages - Standalone pages (index, About, etc.)
#  - data/blog  - Articles in a weblog
#
#
# Happy Hacking!
